This is a simple Calculator written in C programming language.

To run the program:
> Compile the program by 
	```gcc calc.c```
	which generates a 'a.exe' file
> Then, input into the terminal
	```./a.exe```
	which runs the program`


It performs the basic operations :
	> Addition
	> Subtraction
	> Multiplication
	> Division
	> Power

The functionality is built on a switch statement which tests for the operator inputed, and defaults to a 'goto fail' statement ehich prints out "OPeration Failed" to the terminal when an unrecognized operator is inputed
